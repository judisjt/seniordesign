 We are in between two advisors so it is TBD for now.
 
 ## Application Information

We want to make an application to help children learn about music and take a liking to it at an early age.

Not enough kids are exposed to music, so some kids that want to make fire music never get the opportunity to.

The school systems do not give enough kids the opportunity to get into music making so we want to make an app that helps ease kids into music.

Background in application development C# development and a basic background in music creation

We want to make an application that is accessible to kids. It will have a controller for kids to push in different beats and rhythms using a raspberry pi or FPGA board. The demo will include the controller so a rhythm can be made and then the sound production part of it so the beats can be heard.
