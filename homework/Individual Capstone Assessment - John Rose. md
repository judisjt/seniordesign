# Capstone Assessment

## Academic Perspectives

The academic perspective of our project is hitting 3 core fields: Computer Science, Embedded Systems, and Music Theory. We will be using Computer Science for development of the foundation to our music app. This means development of a User Interface and implementing correct data structures to make data easy to handle between the multiple levels of the design. Embedded Systems will be used for the creation of a musical instrument, most likely a electronic piano. This will require software on the musical device to be able to interact with the music app. This will also require creation of a physical device that is easy to use and handle. Music Theory is needed to develop the core functionality of the app. The app will require some development on basic skills that should be taught to learn how to play instruments. This could mean like a lesson on reading music and hitting the right notes on the musical device. We will also use an Agile style to keep on task and meet deadlines correctly.

## College Experiences

College courses will have a big impact on the development of our music app. "Embedded Systems", EECE 5117C, will probably have the most impact on my development of the musical device. I will be working with either a Raspberyy Pi or an FPGA to create the device. Embedded Systems main topics were how to deal with FPGAs and other Real Time Operating Systems to create simple devices. I will also use "The Theory of Formal Language and Automata", CS 5170, to create a correct flow of data and operations to reduce on wasted cycles. Automata also had a focus on creating diagrams, which will be imperative here when multiple groups will have to interact together. I can also see "Software Engineering", EECE 3093C, being crucial here in design and development. "Software Engineering" had a major focus on design techniques to lower the burned on development.

Coop will also have a great impact on our senior design project. I initially worked at Emerson as an IT Helpdesk Technician. This job will be in handy for User Interfact development, because I often had to help out coworkers interact with software. I will be able to notice elements that can cause confusion and elements that should be added to ease the burden of use. My most recent Coop was as a Research Assistant at The Air Force Institute of Technology. My main point of research was on Cube Satellite Development. I got experience working with Real Time Operating Systems and Embedded Systems. Our main focus was on safety and efficency of code, this will be helpful in the development of the musical device. I also got see a multitude of data packetization styles, this will be useful in choosing a method to communicate from our music device to the app.

## Motivation and Project Approach

I am excited to work on this project because it will encompass almost everything I have learned at college. I will also get to work on a whole project from design and requirements through development and finally ending at delivery. College and Coops have mostly had projects where the students come in for a specific stage in a project, but this senior design will let me have one full experience. The preliminary approach to our solution is to design out how the different facets of our project will interact and decide on many key decisions. We need to decide on what hardware we would like to use, communication protocols and packetezation, core framework, and design ideology. This will be interesting because our whole group has different experiences so we can all weigh in on these decisions.

Our expected results will be to learn about how to work as a team to design and implement a project form beginning to end. I think we will accomplish creating an app that kids can use with a physical instrument to learn how read and produce music. We will also learn many different disciplines in development from each other as a team. We will evaluate contributions most likely by using deliverables and deadlines for each member. This is the easiest way to keep track of everyones individual progress with relation to the final product. We will know when we are done when an app has been created that interfaces with a musical device to teach kids how to play an instrument. A hard deadline of telling when we are finished will be hard to decide on, but most likely will be when there is enough lessons for a kid to interact with it for over an hour or two.
