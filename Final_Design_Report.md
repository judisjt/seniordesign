## Project Description
We created a device and application that can easily teach kids about music. This includes the 3-D printing production of an electronic piano-like device. Our software is built to be robust, yet simple, so kids can pick it up and learn with little outside intervention. Our hope is to teach kids about music theory and creation in a fun and educational environment.
